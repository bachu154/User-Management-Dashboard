🔴 Challenges Faced

Handling state updates after CRUD since JSONPlaceholder does not persist changes.

Combining search, filter, and sort without performance lag.

Designing a fully responsive UI across all devices.

🟢 Improvements (Future Enhancements)

Replace mock API with a real backend (Node.js/Express + DB).

Add authentication & role-based access control (Admin/User).

Write unit tests (Jest, React Testing Library).

Enhance UI/UX with animations and design system.
